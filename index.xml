For text input, there is the standard Input widget. By default, this will let the user enter any characters that they wish.
Whenever a new value is entered, textual will fire off an Input.Changed event, that you can handle with an on_input_changed method in your App (or wherever). You may then be tempted to use this handler to validate the user input - the Input has a reactive variable but there’s no easy way to wire something up to an instance’s methods.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Python With Deb</title><link>https://lllama.github.io/posts/deploy-python-with-deb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 12:28:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lllama.github.io/posts/deploy-python-with-deb/</guid><description>One of the worst parts about working with python is how to share your code, or deploy it on another machine. If you&amp;rsquo;re following preferred practices, then you&amp;rsquo;re probably developing using a virtual environment. But that means you need a way to have the same environment where your app is going to run. Either your users need to go through several steps to create a virtual environment and then install your app and its dependencies to it, or you need to ship the environment along with your app.</description></item></channel></rss>
