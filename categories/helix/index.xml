This normally results in me realising that I just needed a change of vim colour scheme but I’ve just discovered Helix which might be just enough like vim for me to stick around.
My reason for giving it a go is that I want something with easy to use language server support. Neovim would probably be a sensible choice but helix seems to be nicely configured out of the box, so I’m going to try that first.</description></item></channel></rss>
