For text input, there is the standard Input widget. By default, this will let the user enter any characters that they wish.
Whenever a new value is entered, textual will fire off an Input.Changed event, that you can handle with an on_input_changed method in your App (or wherever). You may then be tempted to use this handler to validate the user input - the Input has a reactive variable but there’s no easy way to wire something up to an instance’s methods.</description></item></channel></rss>
