Iâ€™d previously used my preferred DERP stack (Django, Ember, REST framework, postgresql) which produced nice enough apps but took a lot of effort and had lots of redundant code: Postgres tables needed to be Django models, which needed to be DRF serialisers, which needed Ember Data models, and then finally rendered to the DOM.
Writing with htmx meant I could have most of the shiny but I only need to produce the html on the server.</description></item></channel></rss>
