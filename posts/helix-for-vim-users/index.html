Though I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m liking Zed a lot these days.</p><p>Periodically, I have a go at using an editor other than vim. This normally results in me realising that I just needed a change of vim colour scheme but I’ve just discovered <a href=https://helix-editor.com/>Helix</a> which might be just enough like vim for me to stick around.</p><p>My reason for giving it a go is that I want something with easy to use language server support. Neovim would probably be a sensible choice but helix seems to be nicely configured out of the box, so I’m going to try that first.</p><p>So here are some notes about translating vim actions into helix:</p><ul><li>Delete to end of line. This is a slightly annoying one. The idea in Helix is that you select things first and then do the action. The movement <code>gl</code> goes to the end of the line but <em>doesn’t</em> select by default. So instead we select to the character before the newline and then delete that.<ul><li>Vim: <code>D</code></li><li>Helix: <code>t&lt;enter>d</code></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=python-tips>Python tips</h2><p>You’ll need to install the <a href=https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server>python language server</a> to get python support. I recommend <a href=https://pypa.github.io/pipx/><code>pipx</code></a> - it’ll install it into its own virtual environment and put it on your path. Helix should then pick it up.</p><p>I also prefer <a href=https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html><code>black</code></a> for formatting, which needs to have its LSP plugin installed using</p><p><code>pipx inject python-lsp-server python-lsp-black</code></p><p>That will install the plugin into the virtual environment used by the LSP.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
