The pain comes with how to construct the drill down urls from the current page. I can get the current URL in my templates with <code>request.url</code> and then append <code>/whatever</code>. This works until I have a link with a trailing slash. Then my urls end up with double slashes and Sanic responds with a 404.</p><p>By default, Sanic will treat urls with and without trailing slashes as the same URL, so one option would be to use the <code>strict_slashes</code> option and prevent the trailing version from working. But then you get extra errors to deal with or redirects to code.</p><p>The answer is to punt the URL construction to the router. Use <code>app.url_for</code> or <code>request.url_for</code> and have it create the full URL for you. Seems obvious but took me longer than it should have.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
